<analysis>Analyzing the tracker for the CoffeeInfo component. This is a simple component that displays coffee information. It receives three string props: `name`, `origin`, and `roast`. No state management, event handling, or animation is required. The component is designed to be Edge compatible.</analysis>
<reasoning>I will create a functional component that accepts the `name`, `origin`, and `roast` props. It will use Tailwind CSS classes for basic formatting and layout to clearly display the coffee information, focusing on a minimalist and readable design as defined by the global styling in the project overview. The component should be directly renderable within the edge runtime.</reasoning>
